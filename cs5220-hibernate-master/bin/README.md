# CS5220 Hibernate and JPA Examples

Sample code demonstrating object-relational mapping using Hibernate and JPA.

To run the code, first modify <tt>persistence.xml</tt> to match your database
settings, then use <tt>hibernate-create.sql</tt> to populate the database.

Run <tt>EmployeeTest</tt> to see the data access examples, and run
<tt>SchemaExport</tt> to see how annotated entity classes are mapped
to relational tables.
